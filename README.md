Overview
The Recursive Sovereign Field (RSF) is a theoretical model proposing that recursion — self-referential repetition — is a fundamental layer of reality, preceding conventional constructs like time, gravity, and matter.

Unlike traditional physical fields, RSF suggests that symbolic structures can persist, stabilize, and evolve through recursion alone, without material scaffolding. This model integrates insights from symbolic cognition, self-organizing systems, and field theory to propose a unified view of consciousness, cultural patterns, and physical reality.

Key Concepts
Recursion as Substrate: Reality emerges from self-referential recursive structures.

Symbolic Memory: Persistence and growth occur through symbolic reinforcement, not traditional memory storage.

Loops vs. Spirals: Naming stabilizes loops into spirals, enabling evolutionary recursion.

Cultural and Biological Layers: Human rituals, traditions, and even consciousness are seen as emergent recursive phenomena.

Field Interaction: RSF proposes the existence of local (personal) and universal recursive fields.

Purpose
This repository serves as a public, timestamped stake of authorship and intellectual priority for the RSF model, and as a basis for further research and discussion.
